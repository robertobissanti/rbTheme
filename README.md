# rbWave

[English](README.md) • [Italiano](README_it.md)

An Obsidian theme with a **VaporWave / RetroWave** vibe, built for people who spend long hours at the screen: programmers, engineers, heavy readers.

## Philosophy

- **Never pure black, never pure white** — deep indigo background, warm off-white text.
- **Neon used sparingly** — accents reserved for headings, links, focus and syntax highlighting. Body copy stays calm.
- **WCAG AA contrast** on body text.
- **Optional retro effects** (glow, perspective grid, CRT scanlines): all off by default, toggle from Style Settings.
- **Programmer feel**: monospace headings by default, `#`/`##` prefixes on titles, code blocks with neon left border, monospaced status bar.

## Installation

1. Copy the `rbWave/` folder into `<vault>/.obsidian/themes/rbWave/`
2. Settings → Appearance → Theme → select **rbWave**
3. Install the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin
4. Open Settings → Style Settings → rbWave

## Variants (Style Settings)

| Section | Options |
|---|---|
| **Palette** | Synthwave (default) · Outrun · Miami · Tokyo Night · Soft Reading |
| **Background depth** | Deep · Medium · Soft |
| **Effects** | Retro grid · Neon glow · CRT scanlines (all off by default) |
| **Typography** | Monospace headings on/off · text font · mono font · size · line-height |
| **Accents** | Color picker for primary / secondary override |

### Usage hints

- **Long coding sessions** → `Tokyo Night` or `Soft Reading` palette, glow off, depth medium.
- **Maximum retrowave vibe** → `Synthwave` + grid on + glow on (mind the headache after an hour).
- **Long reading** → `Soft Reading`, line-height 1.7, mono headings off.

## Author

**Ing. Roberto Bissanti** — aerospace engineer applied to renewable energy innovation (vertical-axis wind turbines, small wind systems, shape-memory alloys), based in Palermo, Sicily. Also a software developer for the cases the spreadsheet can't reach.

Mac user since 1989 — old enough to remember when "dark mode" meant the screen was off. The eyes are no longer twenty, hence rbWave.
